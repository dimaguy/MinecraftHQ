## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Contact me on discord: Dimaguy#7491  
Youll be updated live on the vulnerability fix, which should occur as fast as humanly possible.  
Unfortunately I can't afford to pay bounty on the vulnerability, so all I can do is to thank you.  
The vulnerability can be disclosed after the fix.
